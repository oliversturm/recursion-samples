# POWER -- Programmers' Obsession With Elegant Recursion

To run the samples, 

- Run `dotnet tool restore`, which will install the `sampleviewer` tool
- Run `dotnet sampleviewer`

Use the keyboard commands to navigate the sample viewer:

- Use the red key in parens to navigate to a specific sample
- `v` shows the sample source code in your editor, in case it doesn't fit on screen
- `x` builds and executes the sample
- `r` refreshes the source code if you change it while it's on screen
- `q` returns to the main menu level, or quits the tool

The configuration file for sampleviewer is in `sampleviewer.conf.json`. In case you have trouble with a command on your machine, check out this file and change it to your needs.
